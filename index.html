        We are the Walsenburg Crafts Emporium. A local crafts supply shop working with the community to support your craft
        interests. We plan to have supplies for all kinds of crafts from fiber to electronics. We are starting small, with yarn,
        knitting and crochet supplies, and will expand as we can. We hope to hold classes, and community craft afternoons. Click on
        the QR code, and let us know what kind of craft supplies youâ€™d like to see us carry.
